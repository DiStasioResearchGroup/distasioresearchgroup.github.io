							Cornell Chronicle, March 17, 2025<br>
							<h7>Cornell chemistry researchers have found ways to reduce the environmental impact of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) – found in milk jugs, shampoo bottles, playground equipment and many other things – by developing a machine-learning model that enables manufacturers to customize and improve HDPE materials, decreasing the amount of material needed for various applications. It can also be used to boost the quality of recycled HDPE to rival new, making recycling a more practical process.</h7><br><br>

							Cornell Chronicle, September 19, 2023<br>
							<h7>Robert A. DiStasio Jr., associate professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, and collaborators at the University of Luxembourg and Argonne National Laboratory conducted an extensive computational study of this space and have introduced a novel concept, called “freedom of design,” that can be used to identify molecules with targeted physical and/or chemical properties. The concept has important implications in the fields of rational molecular design and computational drug discovery.</h7><br><br>
